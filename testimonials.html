                "I have had the pleasure of working with Reconstruction over the last 14 months. 
                I enjoy our sessions as I am able to explore and discuss features of personal 
                development that you don’t get through conventional means. Whether that be through 
                exploring topics from meditation and neurohacking to personal wellness and fitness 
                or recovery and spirituality, Reconstruction has supported my growth through a 
                critical developmental phase. Their coaching has motivated me to learn and explore 
                more in my early sobriety."

                "Reconstruction came into my life around a year ago. I had relapsed on drugs after
                many years clean and they represented the first glimmer of hope. They gave me new 
                faith in recovery and literally kept me alive. Their professionalism is outstanding, 
                however, what is more impressive is their ability to make you realize who you really 
                are and how to get closer to that true self. I will be forever grateful for the work 
                Reconstruction has done with me."

                "The Reconstruction team have been mentors, supporters and coaches for our college 
                aged son for the last two years. Together, they have focused on his physical health, 
                emotional health, accountability and ability to be more centered in life – with 
                positive results. During good times as well as stressful times, we view Reconstruction 
                as a valuable and critical component in helping our son achieve his full potential. Both 
                our son and we as his parents are very thankful to have them as part of the family team."

                "Reconstruction has been instrumental in the sobriety and recovery progress of my 
                boyfriend. The coaches have an incredible ability to stay calm and rational even when 
                situations seemed bleak. They are mindful and sensitive of all that goes on around them 
                when engaged in coaching. Coaches at Reconstruction maintain professionalism at all times 
                and are always fair and never imposing."

                "Reconstruction's methods of coaching vary from one-on-one recovery sessions to helping 
                set personal health and fitness goals. The routines and techniques are tailored to their 
                clients individual requirements. Reconstructions reliability is unfaltering and their 
                empathic disposition is a continuous comfort. I am seeing steady, positive progress and 
                growth in every part of my partner. We are both lucky to have Reconstruction in our lives."
