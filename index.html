        <h2>HOW WE DO IT:</h2>
        <p>

      <section class="why section">
        <h2>WHY WE DO IT:</h2>
        <p>
          Reconstruction was founded with the intention of assembling a global group of
          highly effective coaches and therapeutic resources. It is Reconstructions belief 
          that everyone with a complex internal struggle deserves a tailored plan without limitations. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide our service to enhance an individuals unique virtues. Our teams found creativity 
          lacking in most common strategies to instigate change. We believe in creativity. It is a quality 
          we posses in abundance. Creativity drives our process of designing unique solutions.  
        </p>
        <p>
          We didn’t set out to provide a service that only services one piece of a person. We built a service 
          that provides positive augmentation to the whole person. Reconstruction believes systemic change 
          provides the most chance for continued holistic growth and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do it because we’ve found we can be whoever we want to be once we’ve free’d ourselves of what 
          restricts us. 
        </p>
        <p>We help others to provide hope for families and individuals.</p>
